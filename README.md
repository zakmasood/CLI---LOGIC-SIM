CLI---LOGIC-SIM

A command line / python based digital logic simulator built by people for people.
Based off of the fantastic Digital logic simulator by Sebastian Lague and my 
general knowledge.

Current gates: [ AND, NOT, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR ]
<br>Plans - Add different customizable modules and gates such as:</br>
<br>-- HDD / SDD</br>
-- Clock
<br>-- Some other things</br>

~~~~ Short Q/A ~~~~~

Q - What inspired you to make this?
 A - Well after a lot of messing around in Sebastian Lague's digital logic simulator, I found it extremely fun
     and thought I would contribute to the community by putting out this cool CLI based logic simulator!
     
Q - Why? Why go through all the trouble?
 A - Well, I liked the logic sim, but found the code to be unreadable and brain melting at times, even if it
     is easy for him.
     
Well good luck on this monumental task!
